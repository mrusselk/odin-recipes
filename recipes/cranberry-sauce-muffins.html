        <p>Leftover cranberry sauce is obviously great on turkey sandwiches, and it's even delicious warmed up and spooned over ice cream or pancakes, but have you tried it in muffins? This easy recipe for cranberry muffins uses a cup of your smooth or chunky leftover cranberry sauce. The batter comes together in minutes and the moist, sweet muffins are perfect for a post-Thanksgiving breakfast or snack.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flour:</strong> Two cups of all-purpose flour give these leftover cranberry sauce muffins structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Use a combination of white and brown sugar for ultimate sweetness.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking powder</strong>: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it makes the batter rise and creates a fluffy texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Spices and flavorings</strong>: These cozy muffins are flavored with cinnamon, cardamom, a pinch of salt, and vanilla extract.</li>
            <li><strong>Leftover cranberry sauce</strong>: You can use homemade or store-bought cranberry sauce.</li>
