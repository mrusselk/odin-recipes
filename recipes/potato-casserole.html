        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 1</strong><br/>
                Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 2</strong><br/>
                Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 1 1/2-quart baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 3</strong><br/>
                When the potatoes are almost finished, melt 3 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add ham and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 4</strong><br/>
                Drain potatoes; add to the ham mixture and stir to combine. Transfer to the prepared baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 5</strong><br/>
                Melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 6</strong><br/>
                Gradually whisk milk into the flour mixture; season with salt and black pepper. Continue cooking and stirring until thickened, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in Cheddar cheese until melted.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 7</strong><br/>
                Pour cheese sauce over ham and potatoes. Sprinkle bread crumbs over top.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 8</strong><br/>
                Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and browned, 25 to 30 minutes.
